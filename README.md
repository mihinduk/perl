# perl
This is a repository for perl scripts that I have used in the Handley lab

All scripts contain the script name:
\# ncbi_rankedlineage_fill_in_the_blanks.pl


The purpose of the script:
\# This script fills in blanks in the taxonomy files derived from rankedlineage.dmp


And a list of expected input:
\# $ARGV[0] = file derived from NCBI rankedlineage.dmp to be parsed
